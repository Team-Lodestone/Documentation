# What is Project Lodestone?

> [!NOTE]
> This project is still in development!

**Project Lodestone** is a toolset that aims to edit and convert Minecraft worlds across various editions, including Java Edition, Bedrock Edition, all 4J Studios Console (as well as 3DS) Editions, support for both current and legacy versions. Essentially a mega tool.

**Note: We also have custom community-made converter support planned, but it isn't the main focus.**
