# Classic Format Docs

All the documentation here is grouped into sub-folders based on the earliest version the format applies to.

If the same documentation file exists in more than 1 version sub-folder, the format was modified in those versions.

## 3rd Party Formats

We have documentation for some 3rd Party classic formats which you can find in the `3rd_party_formats` folder.
