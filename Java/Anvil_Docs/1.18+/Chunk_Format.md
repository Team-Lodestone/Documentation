# Chunk Format

## Byte Order

Chunk data is stored in **Big Endian** byte order unless mentioned otherwise.

## Chunk NBT Data

| Tag Name | Tag Type | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| DataVersion | IntTag | Version of the chunk NBT structure. |
| xPos | IntTag | X position of the chunk (in absolute chunks from `x`, `z` origin, not relative to the region). |
| yPos | IntTag | Lowest Y section position in the chunk (e.g. `-4` in 1.18). |
| zPos | IntTag | Z position of the chunk (in absolute chunks from `x`, `z` origin, not relative to the region).|
| Status | StringTag | Defines the world generation status of this chunk. <br>It is always one of the following: `minecraft:empty`, `minecraft:structure_starts`, `minecraft:structure_references`, `minecraft:biomes`, `minecraft:noise`, `minecraft:surface`, `minecraft:carvers`, `minecraft:features`, `minecraft:light`, `minecraft:spawn`, or `minecraft:full`. <br>All status except `minecraft:full` are used for chunks called proto-chunks, in other words, for chunks with incomplete generation. |
| LastUpdate | LongTag | Tick when the chunk was last saved. |
| [sections](#section-data) | ListTag of CompoundTags | Each CompoundTag is a section (also known as subchunk). All sections in the world's height are present in this list, even those that are empty (filled with air). |
| [block_entities](#block-entities-data) | ListTag of CompoundTags | Each CompoundTag in this list defines a block entity in this chunk. |
| [Heightmaps](#heightmaps-data) | CompoundTag | Several different heightmaps corresponding to 256 values compacted at 9 bits per word (lowest being 0, highest being 384, both inclusive). |
| [fluid_ticks](#fluid-ticks-data) | ListTag of CompoundTags | Each CompoundTag in this list is an "active" liquid in this chunk waiting to be updated. |
| [block_ticks](#block-ticks-data) | ListTag of CompoundTags | Each CompoundTag in this list is an "active" block in this chunk waiting to be updated. |
| InhabitedTime | LongTag | The cumulative number of ticks players have been in this chunk. Note that this value increases faster when more players are in the chunk. Used for Regional Difficulty. |
| [blending_data](#blending-data) | CompoundTag | This appears to be biome blending data, although more testing is needed to confirm. |
| [structures](#structures-data) | CompoundTag | Structure data in this chunk. |

A block entities data. See the [Minecraft Wiki page](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Chunk_format#Block_entity_format) for details.

### Heightmaps Data

| Tag Name | Tag Type | Description |

| MOTION_BLOCKING_NO_LEAVES | LongArrayTag | The highest block that blocks motion, contains a fluid, or is in the `minecraft:leaves` tag. Longs are stored in **Little Endian** |
| OCEAN_FLOOR | LongArrayTag | The highest block that is neither air or a fluid. Longs are stored in **Little Endian** |
| OCEAN_FLOOR_WG | LongArrayTag | The highest block that is neither air or a fluid, for worldgen. Longs are stored in **Little Endian** |
| WORLD_SURFACE | LongArrayTag | The highest non-air block. Longs are stored in **Little Endian** |
| WORLD_SURFACE_WG | LongArrayTag | The highest non-air block, for worldgen. Longs are stored in **Little Endian** |

### Fluid Ticks Data

| Tag Name | Tag Type | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| i | StringTag | The ID of the block; used to activate the correct block update procedure. |
| p | IntTag | If multiple fluid ticks are scheduled for the same tick, fluid ticks with lower `p` are processed first. If they also have the same `p`, order is unknown. |
| t | IntTag | The number of ticks until processing should occur. May be negative when processing is overdue. |
| x | IntTag | X position. |

## Parsing the Chunk

### Parsing the Blocks

***Variables you'll need to calculate first***

| Name | Type | Formula |
|------|------|---------|
| Bits Per Word | 32-bit integer | `64 - leadingZeros(palette.len())` |
| Blocks Per Word | 32-bit integer | `floor(64 ÷ Bits Per Word)` |
| Block Indices | 32-bit integer array. Size = ceil(4096 ÷ ***Blocks Per Word***) × ***Blocks Per Word*** | Extract ***Blocks Per Word*** indices of ***Bits Per Word*** bits from each 64-bit integer and store them as their own index in the new 32-bit integer array |

Now that you have all the needed variables you can now loop the palette in XZY order (X increments first).

The index can be calculated with `Y × 16 × 16 + Z × 16 + X`.

Indexing the [block palette](#block-palette) should look something like this: `palette.get(block_indices[xzy_index])`

### Parsing the Biomes

***Variables you'll need to calculate first***

| Name | Type | Formula |
|------|------|---------|
| Bits Per Word | 32-bit integer | `64 - leadingZeros(palette.len())` |
| Blocks Per Word | 32-bit integer | `floor(64 ÷ Bits Per Word)` |
| Block Indices | 32-bit integer array. Size = ceil(64 ÷ ***Blocks Per Word***) × ***Blocks Per Word*** | Extract ***Blocks Per Word*** indices of ***Bits Per Word*** bits from each 64-bit integer and store them as their own index in the new 32-bit integer array |

Now that you have all the needed variables you can now loop the palette in XZY order (X increments first).

The index can be calculated with `(Y >> 2 & 0x3) × 16 + (Z >> 2 & 0x3) × 4 + (X >> 2 & 0x3)`.

Indexing the [biome palette](#biome-palette) should look something like this: `palette.get(biome_indices[xzy_index])`

### Parsing the Heightmaps

***Variables you'll need to calculate first***

| Name | Type | Formula |
|------|------|---------|
| Block Indices | 32-bit integer array. Size = 259 (Only 256 indices used) | Extract 7 indices of 9 bits from each 64-bit integer and store them as their own index in the new 32-bit integer array |

Now that you have all the needed variables you can now loop the palette in XZ order (X increments first).

The index can be calculated with `Z × 16 + X`.

Indexing the [heightmap arrays](#heightmaps-data) should look something like this: `heightmap[xz_index] - 64`. Subtract 64 to get the real Y coordinate, otherwise Y-64 with be Y0
