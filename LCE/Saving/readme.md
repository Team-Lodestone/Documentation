# LCE Saving

Saves in LCE are stored in a file under a [few different names](#save-file-names), such as `savegame.dat`, depending on the console. The save file contents are similar to the world folder in Java Edition, with a few minor differences.   
They are also [compressed with different compression methods depending on the console](../Basic%20Info.md#lce-compression).   

If you're on a newer-gen console, specifically PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch, the [Region](../Level/RegionFile.md) files are saved in seperate files *outside* of the main save file, known as a [split save](./Split%20Saves.md).
